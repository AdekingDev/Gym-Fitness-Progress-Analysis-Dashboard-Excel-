# Gym-Fitness-Progress-Analysis-Dashboard-Excel-
Many people track workouts and nutrition but struggle to understand what actually drives progress. In this project, I analyzed daily fitness and nutrition data to uncover trends, correlations, and habits that impact weight and workout performance.  

## Problem Statement

Tracking fitness progress can be misleading when relying only on daily weight changes. This project analyzes workout, nutrition, and activity data to uncover patterns that influence weight trends and fitness consistency.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Charts & Slicers
- Regression & Correlation Analysis

## Key Analysis Performed

- Weight trend analysis with moving averages
- Protein intake vs workout performance correlation
- Weekly calorie and workout pattern analysis
- Habit consistency vs performance comparison
- KPI-driven fitness dashboard

## Key Insights

- Consistent calorie intake reduces weight volatility
- Higher protein intake supports longer workout duration
- Weekly patterns reveal burnout and recovery phases
- Consistency matters more than intensity for long-term progress
